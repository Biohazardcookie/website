  <p>Welcome to Video Game Advocates!</p>

  <p>We are an organization that specifically aims to impact the videogame industry by improving working conditions for 
  developers and prevent predatory practices from publishers such as microtransactions and invasion of privacy. </p>

  <p>Video games are mediums of art that should be expressed freely without exploiting both the 
  artist and audience. Unfortunetly, the video game industry has been left unnoticed and unchecked as of the past few decades,
  resulting in the state that we see today.</p>

  <p>Our goal is to provide the community a neutral outlet where developers and their audiences can discuss and learn any issue that is occuring in 
  the video game industry
